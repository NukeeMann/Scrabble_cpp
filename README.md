# Scrabble_cpp
My first big coding project. Finished at November.

conio2 is just library.

I'm planning to improve and clear the code later.

About the game.
It's cardboard game transfered to code.
So far it is only 1 player mode without rivals.
You can place words, change letters and earn points. It is possible to save and load the game as You wish.
